What is STL in C++?

STL = Standard Template Library

STL is a powerful library in C++ that provides:
- Containers (like arrays, vectors, maps, sets)
- Algorithms (like sort, binary search, reverse)
- Iterators (to traverse containers)
- Function objects (functors)

It saves time, ensures performance, and avoids writing boilerplate code.

Containers in STL
- Sequence Containers – vector, list, deque, array
- Associative Containers – set, map, multiset, multimap
- Unordered Containers – unordered_set, unordered_map
- Container Adapters – stack, queue, priority_queue

What is vector in C++?

A vector is a dynamic array provided by the STL.
It grows automatically when needed (no need to manually manage memory).

Common vector operations:

| Operation         | Code                              |
|------------------|------------------------------------|
| Declaration       | vector<int> v;                    |
| Add element       | v.push_back(10);                  |
| Remove last       | v.pop_back();                     |
| Access            | v[i] or v.at(i)                   |
| Size              | v.size();                         |
| Sort              | sort(v.begin(), v.end());         |
| Iterate           | for (int x : v) cout << x;        |
| Clear all         | v.clear();                        |
