✅ What is Two Pointer Technique?
The Two Pointer Technique is a method where you use two pointers (indices) to scan through a data structure (like an array or string) to solve problems efficiently — often reducing time from O(n²) to O(n).

✅ When to Use:
Use Case	Example Problem
Array is sorted -->	Find a pair with a given sum
String or array reversal -->	Reverse a string
Removing duplicates	--> Remove duplicates from sorted array
Merging arrays -->	Merge two sorted arrays
